# LM Studio Python SDK - Environment Configuration
# =================================================
#
# This file contains example configuration for testing the SDK
# against various LM Studio deployments.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file to .env:
#      cp .env.example .env
#
#   2. Edit .env with your actual values
#
#   3. Load environment variables before running tests:
#      source .env                    # Linux/macOS
#      set -a; source .env; set +a    # Alternative for bash
#
# SECURITY WARNING:
#   - Never commit .env file to git (it's in .gitignore)
#   - Never share .env file containing real API keys
#   - API keys in this example file are FAKE - replace with real ones

# ===== Cloudflare WAF Protected Instance =====
# For testing LM Studio behind Cloudflare Web Application Firewall
#
# Required for: tests/test_cloudflare_integration.py
#
# The SDK will send X-API-Key in HTTP headers during WebSocket handshake
# to pass through Cloudflare WAF authentication before the connection is established.

# Your Cloudflare-protected LM Studio host
# Example: lmstudio.example.com:443 or lmstudio.example.com
LMSTUDIO_CLOUDFLARE_HOST=lmstudio.example.com:443

# Your Cloudflare WAF API key (this is NOT the LM Studio API token)
# This key is checked by Cloudflare BEFORE allowing the WebSocket connection
LMSTUDIO_X_API_KEY=your-cloudflare-waf-api-key-here


# ===== LM Studio API Token (Optional) =====
# LM Studio's own authentication token for WebSocket-level authentication
#
# This is DIFFERENT from X-API-Key:
#   - X-API-Key: HTTP header auth (checked by WAF/proxy before WebSocket)
#   - LMSTUDIO_API_TOKEN: WebSocket payload auth (checked by LM Studio after WebSocket)
#
# Format: sk-lm-XXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
#
# You can use BOTH together:
#   - X-API-Key passes through Cloudflare WAF
#   - LMSTUDIO_API_TOKEN authenticates with LM Studio itself
#
# LMSTUDIO_API_TOKEN=sk-lm-12345678:12345678901234567890


# ===== Custom HTTP Headers (Optional) =====
# Additional custom headers to send in WebSocket handshake
#
# Note: These would need to be set programmatically in code, not via env vars.
# This is just for documentation purposes.
#
# Example in code:
#   client = Client(
#       "lmstudio.example.com:443",
#       http_headers={
#           "X-API-Key": "your-key",
#           "X-Custom-Header": "custom-value"
#       }
#   )
